China is an emerging \nforce in the development of space and the use of space, has the advantage of being a latecomer in the field of air and space, and has no shortage of potential and driving force for development; China needs the world, and the world also needs China; it is a historical necessity to fully integrate w ith the world in the field of aerospace security, integrate the international system and \neventually play a leading role in the international community. It is undeniable that this integration is a difficult, complex process that needs to be actively sought, and whether it can leap from the edge and supporting role of the international aerospace system to the center and play a leading role in the process of integrating into the world depends to a large extent on how China handles its relations with the intern ational community, especially with the extensive \nexistence of aerospace powers. After the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia have moved from confrontation to cooperation in the aerospace field, and their joint participation in \nthe constructi on experiment of the Russian space station has provided us with useful references. \nAt present, as an important field of human social development, aerospace has become a new convergence of interests and the focus of contradictions. We advocate and adhere to the principle of win -win cooperation, that is, in the process of administering space and space, we should \nhandle the space issue in accordance with the norms of international law, take the path of space security and development based on equality, mutual benefit and win -win, resolve differences and \ndisputes between countries in the field of space and space in a peaceful manner, promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and consultation, and seek national space security through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Of course, the principle of win- win cooperation \ncannot be at the expense of one's own air and space security interests, nor can we put one's own air and space security interests above other countries, let alone harm the common air a nd space \nsecurity interests of mankind in order to safeguard our own air and space security interests, but should conform to the realistic development of international relations, adhere to the overall national security concept, and strive to build a more harmonious air and space and harmonious world on the basis of ensuring China's air and space security interests.\nFrom [#2]: {type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\n62 China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept  \n \nChina Aerospace Studies Institute  However, in the long run, only the mutual benefit and win- win results of all countries  in \nthe world are in line with the interests of all countries and the pace of continuous development of \nhuman society. As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is also a major country that has integrated into the world and is steadily moving towards the center of the international political and economic arena, assuming more and more international security \nresponsibilities and obligations. Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \nsecurity.  \nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\"  \n \n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent. In the fac e of increasing risks and challenges, we must give full \nplay to the advantages of long- range arrival, rapid maneuver and precision strikes of air and \nspace forces, actively use war and non -war military operations, strengthen overseas use, achieve \nregional arrival, and take joint actions with other national forces to effectively safeguard national interests from infringement. The effective use of air and space forces to meet the practical needs of expanding national interests is also one of the main goals of  China's aerospace security \nstrategy.  \nIn terms of maritime rights and interests, China has rights and interests disputes with \nneighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have become a regular threat to some extent, and need to respond quickly, deal with them in a timely manner, and take the initiative to protect their rights. In terms of overseas interests, Chinese embassies, enterprises, expatriates, students and other groups abroad need the protection of national forces, espec ially in \nthe event of turmoil or natural disasters in the host country, and even more so when the country where it resides, it needs national military forces to protect overseas economic interests and personnel safety.\nFrom [#3]: {type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\n166 China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept  \n \nChina Aerospace Studies Institute  At the same time, the accelerated development of economic globalization has deepened \nthe interdependence of the interests of all countries to an unprecedented extent, and the \nrelationship between countries with you and me with you, and the relationship between countries that have lost everything and prospered has become a distinctive c haracteristic of the times. \nGlobalization has made it possible for a latecomer country like China to obtain the capital, \ntechnology and resources needed for development through peaceful means, injected more non-\nzero-sum factors into security relations betw een countries, and opened up great prospects for \npeace, development and cooperation. In a certain sense, China's choice to transcend the path of \nmilitary expansion with the path of peaceful development and the model of conflict of interests with a mutually  beneficial and win -win model to achieve great rejuvenation is based on objective \npossibility and subjective initiative. Second, the basic national conditions of large developing countries are the foothold for China to choose the path of peaceful developme nt. As a large \ndeveloping country, China's central task is to concentrate on construction, wholeheartedly seek development, and always base its development on basing itself on its own reality. At present, China has initially completed its transformation fr om a large agricultural country to a major \nindustrial country, and the pace of building a moderately prosperous society in an all -round way \nis accelerating, and it has a solid foundation for peaceful development and has become an important link in the worl d economic chain in the process of economic globalization. The vitality \nand attractiveness of China's economy determine that China's ability to freely carry out market development and resource allocation on a global scale is getting stronger and stronger, and there is no need to safeguard and expand national interests through expansion wars. Third, stable politics and strong national defense are the basic guarantees for China to choose the path of peaceful development. From a political point of view, the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ended the century- old history of bullying, war and turmoil in modern times, and \nlaid a solid foundation for China to embark on the path of peaceful development. The profound lessons of the \"Cultural Revoluti on\" in the past 10 years and the valuable experience of reform \nand opening up over the past 30 years have brought China's political ecology into a mature, stable and pragmatic period. From the perspective of national defense, after more than 60 years of co nstruction, China's defensive national defense system has become increasingly complete, \nand the level of modernization of national defense and the armed forces has been continuously improved. At present, the Chinese armed forces are accelerating the transf ormation from \nmechanization to informationization, the navy has begun to move from the near sea to the deep blue, the air force has gradually changed from territorial air defense to both offensive and defensive and air -space integration, and the rocket for ce initially has the dual strategic functions \nof nuclear deterrence, nuclear counterattack and conventional medium - and long- range precision \nstrike. The continuous improvement of the combat capability of the Chinese military has provided strength support f or containing crises and winning wars, and has also provided a \nguarantee for China's peaceful development. \nEmpty space is a reflection of the ground, a profile of national interests. Peaceful \ndevelopment is the basic aspiration of China's security strategy and the primary choice of China's aerospace security strategy. The theme of the times of peaceful development, the cultural tradition of valuing peace, the consistent concept of peace, the basic national conditions of major developing countries, stable politics, and strong national defense determine the basic orientation of China's security strategy and the strategic path of China's peaceful development in the air and space field.\nFrom [#4]: {type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\nChapter 6 : China's Strategic Means Of Aerospace Security  165 \n \nTranslation published Jan 2023  \"The international community should advocate a new concept of comprehensive, \ncommon and cooperative security, so that our global village will become a  big stage for common \ndevelopment, not an arena for competing with each other, let alone chaos a region or even the \nworld for its own selfishness.\" China must break the historical fate of the rise and fall of great powers, realize a historic innovation in its development model, and embark on a pioneering path \nof peaceful development of world significance in the field of aerospace security. \nPeaceful development has been a consistent strategic ideology since the founding of New \nChina. China is the only big country in the world whose civilization has survived for 5,000 years. \nThis lasting vitality comes from the cultural tradition with \"benevolence\" and \"harmony\" as the core and the strategic orientation of \"virtue\" rather than \"force ,” and the strategy of winning \npeace with strength and achieving security with peace is the crystallization of the survival wisdom of the Chinese nation in history. Since the founding of New China, due to the influence and restrictions of various factors at home and abroad, China's development has taken detours and even suffered major setbacks, but it has never stopped thinking and exploring the issue of peaceful development. In 1978, China implemented the policy of reform and opening up and began to shift the focus of its work to ec onomic construction, entering a golden period of \npeaceful development and opening up a new era of peaceful development. After more than 30 years of practice, adhering to the path of peaceful development has become the will of the state and an established n ational policy. Throughout history and looking around the world, peaceful \ndevelopment is a road that is in keeping with the characteristics of the times and China's national conditions, a road closely linked to economic globalization but independent development, and a road of striving for development while adhering to peace . \n1The core connotation of peaceful \ndevelopment is to seek harmonious development internally and promote peace and cooperation externally, that is, to take advantage of the favorable opportunity of world peace to achieve self -\ndevelopment, and at the same time  to better maintain and promote world peace with self -\ndevelopment; It is to actively participate in the process of economic globalization, operate large \nresources and large markets in the world, cultivate a strong momentum for its own development, \nand at t he same time provide new impetus, space and opportunities for world development, and \nstrive to achieve mutual benefit and win- win with other countries; That is, while adhering to \nopening wider to the outside world, the basic point of development is to rely on its own strength, \nthrough independent innovation, technological progress, scientific management, etc., to clear the \nbottlenecks that restrict development, and to achieve China's sustained and scientific \ndevelopment in the economic, military, scientific  and technological fields.  \nPeaceful development is a major strategic choice to grasp the trend of the times and base \nitself on the actual national conditions. First of all, the theme of the times of peace and \ndevelopment is the condition of the times for China to choose the path of peaceful development. Peaceful development is the theme of the times, the major forces rely on each other, contain each \nother, compete and coexist, there is cooperation in competition, coordination in contradictions, \ncomprom ise in struggle, the possibility of all -out war between major powers is reduced, and \npeace and development have become the strategic orientation of more and more countries.  \n  \n \n1 Ge Dongsheng: \"National Security Strategy Theory,”  Beijing, Military Science Press , 2006 edition , p41.\n",

In a certain sense, China's choice to transcend the path of \nmilitary expansion with the path of peaceful development and the model of conflict of interests with a mutually  beneficial and win -win model to achieve great rejuvenation is based on objective \npossibility and subjective initiative. Second, the basic national conditions of large developing countries are the foothold for China to choose the path of peaceful developme nt. As a large \ndeveloping country, China's central task is to concentrate on construction, wholeheartedly seek development, and always base its development on basing itself on its own reality. At present, China has initially completed its transformation fr om a large agricultural country to a major \nindustrial country, and the pace of building a moderately prosperous society in an all -round way \nis accelerating, and it has a solid foundation for peaceful development and has become an important link in the worl d economic chain in the process of economic globalization. The vitality \nand attractiveness of China's economy determine that China's ability to freely carry out market development and resource allocation on a global scale is getting stronger and stronger, and there is no need to safeguard and expand national interests through expansion wars. Third, stable politics and strong national defense are the basic guarantees for China to choose the path of peaceful development. From a political point of view, the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ended the century- old history of bullying, war and turmoil in modern times, and \nlaid a solid foundation for China to embark on the path of peaceful development. The profound lessons of the \"Cultural Revoluti on\" in the past 10 years and the valuable experience of reform \nand opening up over the past 30 years have brought China's political ecology into a mature, stable and pragmatic period. From the perspective of national defense, after more than 60 years of co nstruction, China's defensive national defense system has become increasingly complete, \nand the level of modernization of national defense and the armed forces has been continuously improved. At present, the Chinese armed forces are accelerating the transf ormation from \nmechanization to informationization, the navy has begun to move from the near sea to the deep blue, the air force has gradually changed from territorial air defense to both offensive and defensive and air -space integration, and the rocket for ce initially has the dual strategic functions \nof nuclear deterrence, nuclear counterattack and conventional medium - and long- range precision \nstrike. The continuous improvement of the combat capability of the Chinese military has provided strength support f or containing crises and winning wars, and has also provided a \nguarantee for China's peaceful development. \nEmpty space is a reflection of the ground, a profile of national interests. Peaceful \ndevelopment is the basic aspiration of China's security strategy and the primary choice of China's aerospace security strategy. The theme of the times of peaceful development, the cultural tradition of valuing peace, the consistent concept of peace, the basic national conditions of major developing countries, stable politics, and strong national defense determine the basic orientation of China's security strategy and the strategic path of China's peaceful development in the air and space field.",

As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is also a major country that has integrated into the world and is steadily moving towards the center of the international political and economic arena, assuming more and more international security \nresponsibilities and obligations. Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \nsecurity.  \nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\"  \n \n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent. In the fac e of increasing risks and challenges, we must give full \nplay to the advantages of long- range arrival, rapid maneuver and precision strikes of air and \nspace forces, actively use war and non -war military operations, strengthen overseas use, achieve \nregional arrival, and take joint actions with other national forces to effectively safeguard national interests from infringement. The effective use of air and space forces to meet the practical needs of expanding national interests is also one of the main goals of  China's aerospace security \nstrategy.  \nIn terms of maritime rights and interests, China has rights and interests disputes with \nneighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have become a regular threat to some extent, and need to respond quickly, deal with them in a timely manner, and take the initiative to protect their rights. In terms of overseas interests, Chinese embassies, enterprises, expatriates, students and other groups abroad need the protection of national forces, espec ially in \nthe event of turmoil or natural disasters in the host country, and even more so when the country where it resides, it needs national military forces to protect overseas economic interests and personnel safety.",

To \\\\nthe north is the  vast Mongolian plateau, and to the north of the plateau is the primeval Siberian \\\\nforest in the cold zone; The northwest is composed of a series of lofty mountains and \\\\ninsurmountable deserts and Gobi; To the northeast, the Xing'an Ridge is separated from t he \\\\nMongolian steppe, to the east by the vast Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, and to the north \\\\nby the Outer Xing'an Ridge that runs east and west to separate northeast China from thousands of \\\\nmiles of frozen Eastern Siberia; The southwest consists of t he world's highest mountain ranges, \\\\nthe Himalayas, Tangula Mountains, Gandis Mountains and the Hengduan Mountains with deep \\\\nvalleys and rapid waters have become an insurmountable natural barrier; To the southeast is a long coastline, and the Pacific Ocean is endless. Third, the land frontier is vast and has a large space for safe living. China is a big country with land power characteristics, with a vast territory, complex terrain, rich human and material resources, and a land territory surrounded by platea us, \\\\nmountains and deserts, which makes China have huge security living space, development potential and strategic room for maneuver.  \\\\nHowever, it must be noted that China's geopolitical environment also has shortcomings: \\\\nFirst, it is difficult to form an air -space security buffer zone. Due to the closed and semi -closed \\\\nnature of China's land territory, it directly faces such a land and space power as Russia in the north, and the relative economic and cultural backwardness caused by geographical conditions in the west and southwest, making it more difficult for China to rely on land to develop outward, its external influence is weak, and it is difficult to form a buffer zone on air and space security, and hostile countries can easily pose a direct air and space security threat to China. Second, it is difficult to effectively ensure the security of strategic maritime passages. China's marine environment is complex, the coast is long, from north to south, spanning temperate, subtropical and tropical, but it does not directly face the ocean, and there is an island chain composed of peninsulas and islands outside the sea area, which forms a blockade trend for China. Third, it is difficult to choose the strategic orientation of national aerospace security. China is l ocated in the \\\\ncenter of Asia, backed by the Eurasian continent, facing the Pacific Ocean, the regional environment is complex, between the two major forces of the world's land and sea, and there are many difficult neighbors to get along with, the strategic  orientation of national air and space \\\\nsecurity is the key to the growth and decline of land or sea forces, because of the strategic pressure and strategic attraction of both land and sea directions, improper decision- making will \\\\nlead to the dispersion of the allocation and use of air and space security strategic forces.  \\\\n2.

China has supplied strike-capable  Caihong and Wing Loong UASs to \\\\nat least Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt , the UAE, Algeria, Serbia, Indonesia, and \\\\nKazakhstan.  \\\\nPrecision-Strike Weapons. As of 2017, China had sold export variant ballistic \\\\nmissile systems, including the M20, BP- 12, and Joint Attack Rocket and Missile \\\\nSystem (JARM), as well as long-range sa tellite-guided rocket  systems. Although \\\\nChina typically does not disclose the count ries purchasing these types of arms, in \\\\n2021, Burma displayed an SY-400 TEL and in 2017 Qatar displayed a JARM.  \\\\nNaval Combatants.  China is a supplier of major naval vessels, highlighted by \\\\nPakistan\\\\u2019s 2015 purchase of eight Yuan class submarines for more than $3 billion. Thailand also purchased one Yuan class s ubmarine in 2017 and originally planned to \\\\npurchase two more. As of late 2021, Thailand\\\\u2019s procurement of the first Yuan \\\\nsubmarine was not fulfilled by China due to  contractual delays , though it delivered \\\\ntwo Ming class submarines to Bangladesh in 2016 and one to Bu rma in 2021. In 2017 \\\\nand 2018, China sold two naval frigates to  Bangladesh and four to Pakistan. In \\\\nSeptember 2019, China made its first-ever sa le of an LPD-class ship to Thailand. \\\\nCombat Aircraft. The PRC is attempting to diversif y its international arms exports \\\\nto include more technological ly advanced combat aircraft. For example, in 2022 the \\\\nPRC has offered to sell its JF-17 aircraft to Argentina. \\\\nChina\\\\u2019s arms sales operate primarily through st ate-run export organizations such as AVIC \\\\nand North Industries Corporation (NORINCO).

China is the only big country in the world whose civilization has survived for 5,000 years. \\\\nThis lasting vitality comes from the cultural tradition with \\\\\\\"benevolence\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"harmony\\\\\\\" as the core and the strategic orientation of \\\\\\\"virtue\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\"force ,\\\\u201d and the strategy of winning \\\\npeace with strength and achieving security with peace is the crystallization of the survival wisdom of the Chinese nation in history. Since the founding of New China, due to the influence and restrictions of various factors at home and abroad, China's development has taken detours and even suffered major setbacks, but it has never stopped thinking and exploring the issue of peaceful development. In 1978, China implemented the policy of reform and opening up and began to shift the focus of its work to ec onomic construction, entering a golden period of \\\\npeaceful development and opening up a new era of peaceful development. After more than 30 years of practice, adhering to the path of peaceful development has become the will of the state and an established n ational policy. Throughout history and looking around the world, peaceful \\\\ndevelopment is a road that is in keeping with the characteristics of the times and China's national conditions, a road closely linked to economic globalization but independent development, and a road of striving for development while adhering to peace . \\\\n1The core connotation of peaceful \\\\ndevelopment is to seek harmonious development internally and promote peace and cooperation externally, that is, to take advantage of the favorable opportunity of world peace to achieve self -\\\\ndevelopment, and at the same time  to better maintain and promote world peace with self -\\\\ndevelopment; It is to actively participate in the process of economic globalization, operate large \\\\nresources and large markets in the world, cultivate a strong momentum for its own development, \\\\nand at t he same time provide new impetus, space and opportunities for world development, and \\\\nstrive to achieve mutual benefit and win- win with other countries; That is, while adhering to \\\\nopening wider to the outside world, the basic point of development is to rely on its own strength, \\\\nthrough independent innovation, technological progress, scientific management, etc., to clear the \\\\nbottlenecks that restrict development, and to achieve China's sustained and scientific \\\\ndevelopment in the economic, military, scientific  and technological fields.  \\\\nPeaceful development is a major strategic choice to grasp the trend of the times and base \\\\nitself on the actual national conditions. First of all, the theme of the times of peace and \\\\ndevelopment is the condition of the times for China to choose the path of peaceful development. Peaceful development is the theme of the times, the major forces rely on each other, contain each \\\\nother, compete and coexist, there is cooperation in competition, coordination in contradictions, \\\\ncomprom ise in struggle, the possibility of all -out war between major powers is reduced, and \\\\npeace and development have become the strategic orientation of more and more countries.  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n1 Ge Dongsheng: \\\\\\\"National Security Strategy Theory,\\\\u201d  Beijing, Military Science Press , 2006 edition , p41.\\\", \\\"[#ad88d54e-6fbf-453e-a7d6-24e76ee23ba8#115] {date=(2019)}\\\\n106\\\\nMajor Production-Sector Snapshots\\\\nMissile and Space.

As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is also a major country that has integrated into the world and is steadily moving towards the center of the international political and economic arena, assuming more and more international security \\\\nresponsibilities and obligations. Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \\\\nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \\\\nsecurity.  \\\\nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \\\\nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \\\\ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \\\\\\\"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \\\\\\\"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \\\\npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \\\\nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\\\\\\\"  \\\\n \\\\n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \\\\n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \\\\nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent. In the fac e of increasing risks and challenges, we must give full \\\\nplay to the advantages of long- range arrival, rapid maneuver and precision strikes of air and \\\\nspace forces, actively use war and non -war military operations, strengthen overseas use, achieve \\\\nregional arrival, and take joint actions with other national forces to effectively safeguard national interests from infringement. The effective use of air and space forces to meet the practical needs of expanding national interests is also one of the main goals of  China's aerospace security \\\\nstrategy.  \\\\nIn terms of maritime rights and interests, China has rights and interests disputes with \\\\nneighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have become a regular threat to some extent, and need to respond quickly, deal with them in a timely manner, and take the initiative to protect their rights. In terms of overseas interests, Chinese embassies, enterprises, expatriates, students and other groups abroad need the protection of national forces, espec ially in \\\\nthe event of turmoil or natural disasters in the host country, and even more so when the country where it resides, it needs national military forces to protect overseas economic interests and personnel safety.\\\", \\\"[#ad88d54e-6fbf-453e-a7d6-24e76ee23ba8#19] {date=(2019)}\\\\n10\\\\nChina\\\\u2019s Military Strategy is directed primar-\\\\nily at an internal audience. Thus, it is replete with party jargon, but it does contain the broad underpinnings of China\\\\u2019s military decision -\\\\nmaking calculus. For example, Beijing sees both threats and opportunities emerging from the evolution of the international community beyond the U.S.-led unipolar framework toward a more integrated global environment shaped by major-power dynamics. Furthermore, China sees itself as an emerging major power that will be able to gain influence as long as it can main -\\\\ntain a stable periphery. As it emerges, Beijing will use its growing power to shape the regional environment in the face of interconnected threats while trying to avoid conflict over core interests: sovereignty, development, and unifi -\\\\ncation. More specifically, China believes it must plan to address the many threats to regional stability because they are individually complex and at the same time contain a potential for external actors, most importantly the United States, to become involved. Nevertheless, China must also look to safeguard its international interests as they multiply and incur additional threats. Finally, as new threats emerge and as other militaries adjust their acquisition, strate-gies, and structure, China knows the PLA must be prepared to fight in new realms and adapt to the modern, high-tech battlefield. \\\\nWith a generally favorable external environment, China will remain in an important period of strategic opportunities for its development, a period in which much can be achieved. Chi -\\\\nna\\\\u2019s comprehensive national strength, core competitiveness and risk-resistance capacity are notably increasing, and China enjoys growing international standing and influence. Domes-tically, the Chinese people\\\\u2019s standard of living has remarkably improved, and Chinese soci-ety remains stable. China, as a large developing country, still faces multiple and complex security threats, as well as increasing external impediments and challenges. Subsistence and development security concerns, as well as traditional and nontraditional security threats, are interwoven. Therefore, China has an arduous task to safeguard its national unification, territorial integrity and development interests.\\\\nAs the world economic and strategic center of gravity is shifting ever more rapidly to the \\\\nAsia-Pacific region, the U.S. carries on its \\\\u2018rebalancing\\\\u2019 strategy and enhances its military presence and its military alliances in this region. Japan is sparing no effort to dodge the postwar mechanism, overhauling its military and security policies. Such development has caused grave concerns among other countries in the region. On the issues concerning Chi -\\\\nna\\\\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, some of its offshore neighbors take provocative actions and reinforce their military presence on China\\\\u2019s reefs and islands\\\", \\\"[#4480ff2f-9628-4f1f-a6fe-bf5fb707d22a#181] {type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\\\\n166 China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept  \\\\n \\\\nChina Aerospace Studies Institute  At the same time, the accelerated development of economic globalization has deepened \\\\nthe interdependence of the interests of all countries to an unprecedented extent, and the \\\\nrelationship between countries with you and me with you, and the relationship between countries that have lost everything and prospered has become a distinctive c haracteristic of the times. \\\\nGlobalization has made it possible for a latecomer country like China to obtain the capital, \\\\ntechnology and resources needed for development through peaceful means, injected more non-\\\\nzero-sum factors into security relations betw een countries, and opened up great prospects for \\\\npeace, development and cooperation. In a certain sense, China's choice to transcend the path of \\\\nmilitary expansion with the path of peaceful development and the model of conflict of interests with a mutually  beneficial and win -win model to achieve great rejuvenation is based on objective \\\\npossibility and subjective initiative. Second, the basic national conditions of large developing countries are the foothold for China to choose the path of peaceful developme nt. As a large \\\\ndeveloping country, China's central task is to concentrate on construction, wholeheartedly seek development, and always base its development on basing itself on its own reality. At present, China has initially completed its transformation fr om a large agricultural country to a major \\\\nindustrial country, and the pace of building a moderately prosperous society in an all -round way \\\\nis accelerating, and it has a solid foundation for peaceful development and has become an important link in the worl d economic chain in the process of economic globalization. The vitality \\\\nand attractiveness of China's economy determine that China's ability to freely carry out market development and resource allocation on a global scale is getting stronger and stronger, and there is no need to safeguard and expand national interests through expansion wars. Third, stable politics and strong national defense are the basic guarantees for China to choose the path of peaceful development. From a political point of view, the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ended the century- old history of bullying, war and turmoil in modern times, and \\\\nlaid a solid foundation for China to embark on the path of peaceful development. The profound lessons of the \\\\\\\"Cultural Revoluti on\\\\\\\" in the past 10 years and the valuable experience of reform \\\\nand opening up over the past 30 years have brought China's political ecology into a mature, stable and pragmatic period. From the perspective of national defense, after more than 60 years of co nstruction, China's defensive national defense system has become increasingly complete, \\\\nand the level of modernization of national defense and the armed forces has been continuously improved. At present, the Chinese armed forces are accelerating the transf ormation from \\\\nmechanization to informationization, the navy has begun to move from the near sea to the deep blue, the air force has gradually changed from territorial air defense to both offensive and defensive and air -space integration, and the rocket for ce initially has the dual strategic functions \\\\nof nuclear deterrence, nuclear counterattack and conventional medium - and long- range precision \\\\nstrike. The continuous improvement of the combat capability of the Chinese military has provided strength support f or containing crises and winning wars, and has also provided a \\\\nguarantee for China's peaceful development. \\\\nEmpty space is a reflection of the ground, a profile of national interests. Peaceful \\\\ndevelopment is the basic aspiration of China's security strategy and the primary choice of China's aerospace security strategy. The theme of the times of peaceful development, the cultural tradition of valuing peace, the consistent concept of peace, the basic national conditions of major developing countries, stable politics, and strong national defense determine the basic orientation of China's security strategy and the strategic path of China's peaceful development in the air and space field.\\\", \\\"[#4480ff2f-9628-4f1f-a6fe-bf5fb707d22a#110] {type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\\\\nChapter 4 : China's Strategic Guidelines and Principles for Aerospace Security  95 \\\\n \\\\nTranslation published Jan 2023  Strengthening international aerospace cooperation and relying on collective action and \\\\nstrength can not only effectively respond to the new threats facing China's aerospace security, \\\\nbut also a necessary means to demonstrate national will, demonstrate national strength, defend \\\\nnational interests, accumulate moral resources, and enhance national image. China advocates and adheres to the principle of win -win cooperation, takes mutual respect for each other's space \\\\ninterests as the premise, aims to enhance mutual trust, expand consensus and deepen cooperation \\\\nin aerospace security, transcends the shackles of social systems and ideologies, transcends \\\\ncultural and historical entanglements, overcomes the limitations of nation -state interests, \\\\nunderstands and examines those common interests in the field of aerospace security that have a bearing on the survival and development of the entire human society with a global perspective and a positive attitude, and strives to seek the intersection of the interests of all parties , a big country that is developing peacefully, a big country that has established t he \\\\\\\"Chinese dream ,\\\\u201d \\\\nand is responsible for the history of building a harmonious space and seeking to build a harmonious world.  \\\\nWin-win cooperation must have a lofty vision and a broad mind. China is an emerging \\\\nforce in the development of space and the use of space, has the advantage of being a latecomer in the field of air and space, and has no shortage of potential and driving force for development; China needs the world, and the world also needs China; it is a historical necessity to fully integrate w ith the world in the field of aerospace security, integrate the international system and \\\\neventually play a leading role in the international community. It is undeniable that this integration is a difficult, complex process that needs to be actively sought, and whether it can leap from the edge and supporting role of the international aerospace system to the center and play a leading role in the process of integrating into the world depends to a large extent on how China handles its relations with the intern ational community, especially with the extensive \\\\nexistence of aerospace powers. After the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia have moved from confrontation to cooperation in the aerospace field, and their joint participation in \\\\nthe constructi on experiment of the Russian space station has provided us with useful references. \\\\nAt present, as an important field of human social development, aerospace has become a new convergence of interests and the focus of contradictions. We advocate and adhere to the principle of win -win cooperation, that is, in the process of administering space and space, we should \\\\nhandle the space issue in accordance with the norms of international law, take the path of space security and development based on equality, mutual benefit and win -win, resolve differences and \\\\ndisputes between countries in the field of space and space in a peaceful manner, promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and consultation, and seek national space security through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Of course, the principle of win- win cooperation \\\\ncannot be at the expense of one's own air and space security interests, nor can we put one's own air and space security interests above other countries, let alone harm the common air a nd space \\\\nsecurity interests of mankind in order to safeguard our own air and space security interests, but should conform to the realistic development of international relations, adhere to the overall national security concept, and strive to build a more harmonious air and space and harmonious world on the basis of ensuring China's air and space security interests.\\\", \\\"[#b5a017a0-ef25-4516-9120-5f39a08e8038#1] {header=(The Chinese Air Force Evolving Concepts, Roles, and Capabilities), type=(Organization)}\\\\nCenter for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (CSCMA)\\\\nThe Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (China Center) was \\\\nestablished as an integral part of the National Defense University\\\\u2019s  \\\\nInstitute for National Strategic Studies on March 1, 2000, pursuant to Section 914 of the 2000 National Defense Authorization Act.

Second, it is difficult to effectively ensure the security of strategic maritime passages. China's marine environment is complex, the coast is long, from north to south, spanning temperate, subtropical and tropical, but it does not directly face the ocean, and there is an island chain composed of peninsulas and islands outside the sea area, which forms a blockade trend for China. Third, it is difficult to choose the strategic orientation of national aerospace security. China is l ocated in the \\\\ncenter of Asia, backed by the Eurasian continent, facing the Pacific Ocean, the regional environment is complex, between the two major forces of the world's land and sea, and there are many difficult neighbors to get along with, the strategic  orientation of national air and space \\\\nsecurity is the key to the growth and decline of land or sea forces, because of the strategic pressure and strategic attraction of both land and sea directions, improper decision- making will \\\\nlead to the dispersion of the allocation and use of air and space security strategic forces.  \\\\n2.

As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is also a major country that has integrated into the world and is steadily moving towards the center of the international political and economic arena, assuming more and more international security \\\\nresponsibilities and obligations. Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \\\\nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \\\\nsecurity.  \\\\nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \\\\nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \\\\ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \\\\\\\"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \\\\\\\"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \\\\npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \\\\nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\\\\\\\"  \\\\n \\\\n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \\\\n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \\\\nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent.

In a certain sense, China's choice to transcend the path of \\\\nmilitary expansion with the path of peaceful development and the model of conflict of interests with a mutually  beneficial and win -win model to achieve great rejuvenation is based on objective \\\\npossibility and subjective initiative. Second, the basic national conditions of large developing countries are the foothold for China to choose the path of peaceful developme nt. As a large \\\\ndeveloping country, China's central task is to concentrate on construction, wholeheartedly seek development, and always base its development on basing itself on its own reality. At present, China has initially completed its transformation fr om a large agricultural country to a major \\\\nindustrial country, and the pace of building a moderately prosperous society in an all -round way \\\\nis accelerating, and it has a solid foundation for peaceful development and has become an important link in the worl d economic chain in the process of economic globalization. The vitality \\\\nand attractiveness of China's economy determine that China's ability to freely carry out market development and resource allocation on a global scale is getting stronger and stronger, and there is no need to safeguard and expand national interests through expansion wars. Third, stable politics and strong national defense are the basic guarantees for China to choose the path of peaceful development. From a political point of view, the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ended the century- old history of bullying, war and turmoil in modern times, and \\\\nlaid a solid foundation for China to embark on the path of peaceful development. The profound lessons of the \\\\\\\"Cultural Revoluti on\\\\\\\" in the past 10 years and the valuable experience of reform \\\\nand opening up over the past 30 years have brought China's political ecology into a mature, stable and pragmatic period. From the perspective of national defense, after more than 60 years of co nstruction, China's defensive national defense system has become increasingly complete, \\\\nand the level of modernization of national defense and the armed forces has been continuously improved.

It is undeniable that this integration is a difficult, complex process that needs to be actively sought, and whether it can leap from the edge and supporting role of the international aerospace system to the center and play a leading role in the process of integrating into the world depends to a large extent on how China handles its relations with the intern ational community, especially with the extensive \\\\nexistence of aerospace powers. After the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia have moved from confrontation to cooperation in the aerospace field, and their joint participation in \\\\nthe constructi on experiment of the Russian space station has provided us with useful references. \\\\nAt present, as an important field of human social development, aerospace has become a new convergence of interests and the focus of contradictions. We advocate and adhere to the principle of win -win cooperation, that is, in the process of administering space and space, we should \\\\nhandle the space issue in accordance with the norms of international law, take the path of space security and development based on equality, mutual benefit and win -win, resolve differences and \\\\ndisputes between countries in the field of space and space in a peaceful manner, promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and consultation, and seek national space security through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Of course, the principle of win- win cooperation \\\\ncannot be at the expense of one's own air and space security interests, nor can we put one's own air and space security interests above other countries, let alone harm the common air a nd space \\\\nsecurity interests of mankind in order to safeguard our own air and space security interests, but should conform to the realistic development of international relations, adhere to the overall national security concept, and strive to build a more harmonious air and space and harmonious world on the basis of ensuring China's air and space security interests.\\\", \\\"pageNumber\\\": 111}, \\\"reference_map\\\": null, \\\"score\\\": 18.228139877319336, \\\"normalized_score\\\": 0.5696293711662292, \\\"rank\\\": 8}}, {\\\"page_content\\\": \\\"{header=(The Chinese Air Force Evolving Concepts, Roles, and Capabilities), type=(Organization)}\\\\nCenter for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (CSCMA)\\\\nThe Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (China Center) was \\\\nestablished as an integral part of the National Defense University\\\\u2019s  \\\\nInstitute for National Strategic Studies on March 1, 2000, pursuant to Section 914 of the 2000 National Defense Authorization Act.

To \\\\\\\\nthe north is the  vast Mongolian plateau, and to the north of the plateau is the primeval Siberian \\\\\\\\nforest in the cold zone; The northwest is composed of a series of lofty mountains and \\\\\\\\ninsurmountable deserts and Gobi; To the northeast, the Xing'an Ridge is separated from t he \\\\\\\\nMongolian steppe, to the east by the vast Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, and to the north \\\\\\\\nby the Outer Xing'an Ridge that runs east and west to separate northeast China from thousands of \\\\\\\\nmiles of frozen Eastern Siberia; The southwest consists of t he world's highest mountain ranges, \\\\\\\\nthe Himalayas, Tangula Mountains, Gandis Mountains and the Hengduan Mountains with deep \\\\\\\\nvalleys and rapid waters have become an insurmountable natural barrier; To the southeast is a long coastline, and the Pacific Ocean is endless. Third, the land frontier is vast and has a large space for safe living. China is a big country with land power characteristics, with a vast territory, complex terrain, rich human and material resources, and a land territory surrounded by platea us, \\\\\\\\nmountains and deserts, which makes China have huge security living space, development potential and strategic room for maneuver.  \\\\\\\\nHowever, it must be noted that China's geopolitical environment also has shortcomings: \\\\\\\\nFirst, it is difficult to form an air -space security buffer zone. Due to the closed and semi -closed \\\\\\\\nnature of China's land territory, it directly faces such a land and space power as Russia in the north, and the relative economic and cultural backwardness caused by geographical conditions in the west and southwest, making it more difficult for China to rely on land to develop outward, its external influence is weak, and it is difficult to form a buffer zone on air and space security, and hostile countries can easily pose a direct air and space security threat to China. Second, it is difficult to effectively ensure the security of strategic maritime passages. China's marine environment is complex, the coast is long, from north to south, spanning temperate, subtropical and tropical, but it does not directly face the ocean, and there is an island chain composed of peninsulas and islands outside the sea area, which forms a blockade trend for China. Third, it is difficult to choose the strategic orientation of national aerospace security. China is l ocated in the \\\\\\\\ncenter of Asia, backed by the Eurasian continent, facing the Pacific Ocean, the regional environment is complex, between the two major forces of the world's land and sea, and there are many difficult neighbors to get along with, the strategic  orientation of national air and space \\\\\\\\nsecurity is the key to the growth and decline of land or sea forces, because of the strategic pressure and strategic attraction of both land and sea directions, improper decision- making will \\\\\\\\nlead to the dispersion of the allocation and use of air and space security strategic forces.  \\\\\\\\n2. Natural resources  \\\\\\\\nNatural resources constrain the scale and level of national aerospace security strategic \\\\\\\\ncapacity -building. China is a country with a relatively complete range of natural resources, with \\\\\\\\n171 kinds of mineral resources discovered, 158 kinds of identified resource reserves, the total amount is relatively rich, and the actual utilization of major natural resources ranks second in the world, which provides necessary mat erial support for the national air and space security strategic \\\\\\\\ncapacity building.\\\\\\\\n1 \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n1 Yang Yi: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"China's National Security Strategic Concept ,\\\\\\\\u201d Beijing, Shishi Publishing House , 2009 edition , p117 . \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[#f4e58e31-c3f0-4eb2-b2a2-60c2076fd4e0#169] {type=(Facility), header=(Military and Security Developments Involving the People\\\\\\\\u2019s Republic of China)}\\\\\\\\n152 \\\\\\\\nOFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE \\\\\\\\nAnnual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People\\\\\\\\u2019s Republic of China  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u00a0hardware, such as advanced semiconductor fa brication factories an d electronic design \\\\\\\\nautomation software, PRC researchers are explor ing new materials and design concepts for \\\\\\\\nnext-generation semiconductors. \\\\\\\\nLast year, China designed and fabricated a quantum computer capab le of outperforming a \\\\\\\\nclassical high-performance computer for a sp ecific problem.

China is the fifth-largest arms supplier in the world, and sells nearly \\\\\\\\nevery category of conventional military eq uipment including UASs, submarines, naval \\\\\\\\nsurface vessels, surface to air missile systems and fighter aircraft to customers like Saudi \\\\\\\\nArabia, Serbia, the UAE, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Iraq, and Pakistan.      \\\\\\\\nArmed UASs. China has supplied strike-capable  Caihong and Wing Loong UASs to \\\\\\\\nat least Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt , the UAE, Algeria, Serbia, Indonesia, and \\\\\\\\nKazakhstan.  \\\\\\\\nPrecision-Strike Weapons. As of 2017, China had sold export variant ballistic \\\\\\\\nmissile systems, including the M20, BP- 12, and Joint Attack Rocket and Missile \\\\\\\\nSystem (JARM), as well as long-range sa tellite-guided rocket  systems. Although \\\\\\\\nChina typically does not disclose the count ries purchasing these types of arms, in \\\\\\\\n2021, Burma displayed an SY-400 TEL and in 2017 Qatar displayed a JARM.  \\\\\\\\nNaval Combatants.  China is a supplier of major naval vessels, highlighted by \\\\\\\\nPakistan\\\\\\\\u2019s 2015 purchase of eight Yuan class submarines for more than $3 billion. Thailand also purchased one Yuan class s ubmarine in 2017 and originally planned to \\\\\\\\npurchase two more. As of late 2021, Thailand\\\\\\\\u2019s procurement of the first Yuan \\\\\\\\nsubmarine was not fulfilled by China due to  contractual delays , though it delivered \\\\\\\\ntwo Ming class submarines to Bangladesh in 2016 and one to Bu rma in 2021. In 2017 \\\\\\\\nand 2018, China sold two naval frigates to  Bangladesh and four to Pakistan. In \\\\\\\\nSeptember 2019, China made its first-ever sa le of an LPD-class ship to Thailand. \\\\\\\\nCombat Aircraft. The PRC is attempting to diversif y its international arms exports \\\\\\\\nto include more technological ly advanced combat aircraft. For example, in 2022 the \\\\\\\\nPRC has offered to sell its JF-17 aircraft to Argentina. \\\\\\\\nChina\\\\\\\\u2019s arms sales operate primarily through st ate-run export organizations such as AVIC \\\\\\\\nand North Industries Corporation (NORINCO). Ar ms transfers also are a component of the \\\\\\\\nPRC\\\\\\\\u2019s foreign policy, used in conjunction with  other types of assistance to complement \\\\\\\\nforeign policy initiatives undertaken as part of China\\\\\\\\u2019s BRI policy. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[#4480ff2f-9628-4f1f-a6fe-bf5fb707d22a#180] {type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\\\\\\\\nChapter 6 : China's Strategic Means Of Aerospace Security  165 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTranslation published Jan 2023  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The international community should advocate a new concept of comprehensive, \\\\\\\\ncommon and cooperative security, so that our global village will become a  big stage for common \\\\\\\\ndevelopment, not an arena for competing with each other, let alone chaos a region or even the \\\\\\\\nworld for its own selfishness.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" China must break the historical fate of the rise and fall of great powers, realize a historic innovation in its development model, and embark on a pioneering path \\\\\\\\nof peaceful development of world significance in the field of aerospace security. \\\\\\\\nPeaceful development has been a consistent strategic ideology since the founding of New \\\\\\\\nChina. China is the only big country in the world whose civilization has survived for 5,000 years. \\\\\\\\nThis lasting vitality comes from the cultural tradition with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"benevolence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"harmony\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the core and the strategic orientation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"force ,\\\\\\\\u201d and the strategy of winning \\\\\\\\npeace with strength and achieving security with peace is the crystallization of the survival wisdom of the Chinese nation in history. Since the founding of New China, due to the influence and restrictions of various factors at home and abroad, China's development has taken detours and even suffered major setbacks, but it has never stopped thinking and exploring the issue of peaceful development. In 1978, China implemented the policy of reform and opening up and began to shift the focus of its work to ec onomic construction, entering a golden period of \\\\\\\\npeaceful development and opening up a new era of peaceful development. After more than 30 years of practice, adhering to the path of peaceful development has become the will of the state and an established n ational policy. Throughout history and looking around the world, peaceful \\\\\\\\ndevelopment is a road that is in keeping with the characteristics of the times and China's national conditions, a road closely linked to economic globalization but independent development, and a road of striving for development while adhering to peace . \\\\\\\\n1The core connotation of peaceful \\\\\\\\ndevelopment is to seek harmonious development internally and promote peace and cooperation externally, that is, to take advantage of the favorable opportunity of world peace to achieve self -\\\\\\\\ndevelopment, and at the same time  to better maintain and promote world peace with self -\\\\\\\\ndevelopment; It is to actively participate in the process of economic globalization, operate large \\\\\\\\nresources and large markets in the world, cultivate a strong momentum for its own development, \\\\\\\\nand at t he same time provide new impetus, space and opportunities for world development, and \\\\\\\\nstrive to achieve mutual benefit and win- win with other countries; That is, while adhering to \\\\\\\\nopening wider to the outside world, the basic point of development is to rely on its own strength, \\\\\\\\nthrough independent innovation, technological progress, scientific management, etc., to clear the \\\\\\\\nbottlenecks that restrict development, and to achieve China's sustained and scientific \\\\\\\\ndevelopment in the economic, military, scientific  and technological fields.  \\\\\\\\nPeaceful development is a major strategic choice to grasp the trend of the times and base \\\\\\\\nitself on the actual national conditions. First of all, the theme of the times of peace and \\\\\\\\ndevelopment is the condition of the times for China to choose the path of peaceful development. Peaceful development is the theme of the times, the major forces rely on each other, contain each \\\\\\\\nother, compete and coexist, there is cooperation in competition, coordination in contradictions, \\\\\\\\ncomprom ise in struggle, the possibility of all -out war between major powers is reduced, and \\\\\\\\npeace and development have become the strategic orientation of more and more countries.  \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n1 Ge Dongsheng: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"National Security Strategy Theory,\\\\\\\\u201d  Beijing, Military Science Press , 2006 edition , p41. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[#ad88d54e-6fbf-453e-a7d6-24e76ee23ba8#115] {date=(2019)}\\\\\\\\n106\\\\\\\\nMajor Production-Sector Snapshots\\\\\\\\nMissile and Space.

As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is also a major country that has integrated into the world and is steadily moving towards the center of the international political and economic arena, assuming more and more international security \\\\\\\\nresponsibilities and obligations. Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \\\\\\\\nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \\\\\\\\nsecurity.  \\\\\\\\nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \\\\\\\\nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \\\\\\\\ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \\\\\\\\npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \\\\\\\\nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \\\\\\\\n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \\\\\\\\nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent. In the fac e of increasing risks and challenges, we must give full \\\\\\\\nplay to the advantages of long- range arrival, rapid maneuver and precision strikes of air and \\\\\\\\nspace forces, actively use war and non -war military operations, strengthen overseas use, achieve \\\\\\\\nregional arrival, and take joint actions with other national forces to effectively safeguard national interests from infringement. The effective use of air and space forces to meet the practical needs of expanding national interests is also one of the main goals of  China's aerospace security \\\\\\\\nstrategy.  \\\\\\\\nIn terms of maritime rights and interests, China has rights and interests disputes with \\\\\\\\nneighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have become a regular threat to some extent, and need to respond quickly, deal with them in a timely manner, and take the initiative to protect their rights. In terms of overseas interests, Chinese embassies, enterprises, expatriates, students and other groups abroad need the protection of national forces, espec ially in \\\\\\\\nthe event of turmoil or natural disasters in the host country, and even more so when the country where it resides, it needs national military forces to protect overseas economic interests and personnel safety. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[#ad88d54e-6fbf-453e-a7d6-24e76ee23ba8#19] {date=(2019)}\\\\\\\\n10\\\\\\\\nChina\\\\\\\\u2019s Military Strategy is directed primar-\\\\\\\\nily at an internal audience. Thus, it is replete with party jargon, but it does contain the broad underpinnings of China\\\\\\\\u2019s military decision -\\\\\\\\nmaking calculus. For example, Beijing sees both threats and opportunities emerging from the evolution of the international community beyond the U.S.-led unipolar framework toward a more integrated global environment shaped by major-power dynamics. Furthermore, China sees itself as an emerging major power that will be able to gain influence as long as it can main -\\\\\\\\ntain a stable periphery. As it emerges, Beijing will use its growing power to shape the regional environment in the face of interconnected threats while trying to avoid conflict over core interests: sovereignty, development, and unifi -\\\\\\\\ncation. More specifically, China believes it must plan to address the many threats to regional stability because they are individually complex and at the same time contain a potential for external actors, most importantly the United States, to become involved. Nevertheless, China must also look to safeguard its international interests as they multiply and incur additional threats. Finally, as new threats emerge and as other militaries adjust their acquisition, strate-gies, and structure, China knows the PLA must be prepared to fight in new realms and adapt to the modern, high-tech battlefield. \\\\\\\\nWith a generally favorable external environment, China will remain in an important period of strategic opportunities for its development, a period in which much can be achieved. Chi -\\\\\\\\nna\\\\\\\\u2019s comprehensive national strength, core competitiveness and risk-resistance capacity are notably increasing, and China enjoys growing international standing and influence. Domes-tically, the Chinese people\\\\\\\\u2019s standard of living has remarkably improved, and Chinese soci-ety remains stable. China, as a large developing country, still faces multiple and complex security threats, as well as increasing external impediments and challenges. Subsistence and development security concerns, as well as traditional and nontraditional security threats, are interwoven. Therefore, China has an arduous task to safeguard its national unification, territorial integrity and development interests.\\\\\\\\nAs the world economic and strategic center of gravity is shifting ever more rapidly to the \\\\\\\\nAsia-Pacific region, the U.S. carries on its \\\\\\\\u2018rebalancing\\\\\\\\u2019 strategy and enhances its military presence and its military alliances in this region.

As one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is also a major country that has integrated into the world and is steadily moving towards the center of the international political and economic arena, assuming more and more international security \\\\\\\\nresponsibilities and obligations. Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \\\\\\\\nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \\\\\\\\nsecurity.  \\\\\\\\nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \\\\\\\\nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \\\\\\\\ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \\\\\\\\npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \\\\\\\\nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \\\\\\\\n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \\\\\\\\nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent. In the fac e of increasing risks and challenges, we must give full \\\\\\\\nplay to the advantages of long- range arrival, rapid maneuver and precision strikes of air and \\\\\\\\nspace forces, actively use war and non -war military operations, strengthen overseas use, achieve \\\\\\\\nregional arrival, and take joint actions with other national forces to effectively safeguard national interests from infringement. The effective use of air and space forces to meet the practical needs of expanding national interests is also one of the main goals of  China's aerospace security \\\\\\\\nstrategy.  \\\\\\\\nIn terms of maritime rights and interests, China has rights and interests disputes with \\\\\\\\nneighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have become a regular threat to some extent, and need to respond quickly, deal with them in a timely manner, and take the initiative to protect their rights. In terms of overseas interests, Chinese embassies, enterprises, expatriates, students and other groups abroad need the protection of national forces, espec ially in \\\\\\\\nthe event of turmoil or natural disasters in the host country, and even more so when the country where it resides, it needs national military forces to protect overseas economic interests and personnel safety.\\\\\\\"]}, \\\\\\\"This approach is based on the objective possibility and subjective initiative provided by economic globalization, which has deepened the interdependence of countries' interests and opened up great prospects for peace, development, and cooperation.\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\": [0.6731467843055725], \\\\\\\"following_chars\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\"4480ff2f-9628-4f1f-a6fe-bf5fb707d22a#181\\\\\\\"], \\\\\\\"page_content\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\"{type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\\\\\\\\n166 China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nChina Aerospace Studies Institute  At the same time, the accelerated development of economic globalization has deepened \\\\\\\\nthe interdependence of the interests of all countries to an unprecedented extent, and the \\\\\\\\nrelationship between countries with you and me with you, and the relationship between countries that have lost everything and prospered has become a distinctive c haracteristic of the times. \\\\\\\\nGlobalization has made it possible for a latecomer country like China to obtain the capital, \\\\\\\\ntechnology and resources needed for development through peaceful means, injected more non-\\\\\\\\nzero-sum factors into security relations betw een countries, and opened up great prospects for \\\\\\\\npeace, development and cooperation.

China is an emerging \\\\\\\\nforce in the development of space and the use of space, has the advantage of being a latecomer in the field of air and space, and has no shortage of potential and driving force for development; China needs the world, and the world also needs China; it is a historical necessity to fully integrate w ith the world in the field of aerospace security, integrate the international system and \\\\\\\\neventually play a leading role in the international community. It is undeniable that this integration is a difficult, complex process that needs to be actively sought, and whether it can leap from the edge and supporting role of the international aerospace system to the center and play a leading role in the process of integrating into the world depends to a large extent on how China handles its relations with the intern ational community, especially with the extensive \\\\\\\\nexistence of aerospace powers. After the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia have moved from confrontation to cooperation in the aerospace field, and their joint participation in \\\\\\\\nthe constructi on experiment of the Russian space station has provided us with useful references. \\\\\\\\nAt present, as an important field of human social development, aerospace has become a new convergence of interests and the focus of contradictions.

Of course, the principle of win- win cooperation \\\\\\\\ncannot be at the expense of one's own air and space security interests, nor can we put one's own air and space security interests above other countries, let alone harm the common air a nd space \\\\\\\\nsecurity interests of mankind in order to safeguard our own air and space security interests, but should conform to the realistic development of international relations, adhere to the overall national security concept, and strive to build a more harmonious air and space and harmonious world on the basis of ensuring China's air and space security interests.\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"{type=(Facility), header=(In Their Own Words: China's Aerospace Security Strategic Concept)}\\\\\\\\nChapter 6 : China's Strategic Means Of Aerospace Security  165 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTranslation published Jan 2023  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The international community should advocate a new concept of comprehensive, \\\\\\\\ncommon and cooperative security, so that our global village will become a  big stage for common \\\\\\\\ndevelopment, not an arena for competing with each other, let alone chaos a region or even the \\\\\\\\nworld for its own selfishness.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" China must break the historical fate of the rise and fall of great powers, realize a historic innovation in its development model, and embark on a pioneering path \\\\\\\\nof peaceful development of world significance in the field of aerospace security. \\\\\\\\nPeaceful development has been a consistent strategic ideology since the founding of New \\\\\\\\nChina.

Throughout history and looking around the world, peaceful \\\\\\\\ndevelopment is a road that is in keeping with the characteristics of the times and China's national conditions, a road closely linked to economic globalization but independent development, and a road of striving for development while adhering to peace . \\\\\\\\n1The core connotation of peaceful \\\\\\\\ndevelopment is to seek harmonious development internally and promote peace and cooperation externally, that is, to take advantage of the favorable opportunity of world peace to achieve self -\\\\\\\\ndevelopment, and at the same time  to better maintain and promote world peace with self -\\\\\\\\ndevelopment; It is to actively participate in the process of economic globalization, operate large \\\\\\\\nresources and large markets in the world, cultivate a strong momentum for its own development, \\\\\\\\nand at t he same time provide new impetus, space and opportunities for world development, and \\\\\\\\nstrive to achieve mutual benefit and win- win with other countries; That is, while adhering to \\\\\\\\nopening wider to the outside world, the basic point of development is to rely on its own strength, \\\\\\\\nthrough independent innovation, technological progress, scientific management, etc., to clear the \\\\\\\\nbottlenecks that restrict development, and to achieve China's sustained and scientific \\\\\\\\ndevelopment in the economic, military, scientific  and technological fields.  \\\\\\\\nPeaceful development is a major strategic choice to grasp the trend of the times and base \\\\\\\\nitself on the actual national conditions. First of all, the theme of the times of peace and \\\\\\\\ndevelopment is the condition of the times for China to choose the path of peaceful development. Peaceful development is the theme of the times, the major forces rely on each other, contain each \\\\\\\\nother, compete and coexist, there is cooperation in competition, coordination in contradictions, \\\\\\\\ncomprom ise in struggle, the possibility of all -out war between major powers is reduced, and \\\\\\\\npeace and development have become the strategic orientation of more and more countries.  \\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n1 Ge Dongsheng: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"National Security Strategy Theory,\\\\\\\\u201d  Beijing, Military Science Press , 2006 edition , p41.\\\\\\\"]}}\\\", \\\"script\\\": null, \\\"rewritten_question\\\": \\\"china\\\", \\\"conversation_history\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"Q. china  A.

Throughout history and looking around the world, peaceful \\\\ndevelopment is a road that is in keeping with the characteristics of the times and China's national conditions, a road closely linked to economic globalization but independent development, and a road of striving for development while adhering to peace . \\\\n1The core connotation of peaceful \\\\ndevelopment is to seek harmonious development internally and promote peace and cooperation externally, that is, to take advantage of the favorable opportunity of world peace to achieve self -\\\\ndevelopment, and at the same time  to better maintain and promote world peace with self -\\\\ndevelopment; It is to actively participate in the process of economic globalization, operate large \\\\nresources and large markets in the world, cultivate a strong momentum for its own development, \\\\nand at t he same time provide new impetus, space and opportunities for world development, and \\\\nstrive to achieve mutual benefit and win- win with other countries; That is, while adhering to \\\\nopening wider to the outside world, the basic point of development is to rely on its own strength, \\\\nthrough independent innovation, technological progress, scientific management, etc., to clear the \\\\nbottlenecks that restrict development, and to achieve China's sustained and scientific \\\\ndevelopment in the economic, military, scientific  and technological fields.  \\\\nPeaceful development is a major strategic choice to grasp the trend of the times and base \\\\nitself on the actual national conditions. First of all, the theme of the times of peace and \\\\ndevelopment is the condition of the times for China to choose the path of peaceful development. Peaceful development is the theme of the times, the major forces rely on each other, contain each \\\\nother, compete and coexist, there is cooperation in competition, coordination in contradictions, \\\\ncomprom ise in struggle, the possibility of all -out war between major powers is reduced, and \\\\npeace and development have become the strategic orientation of more and more countries.  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n1 Ge Dongsheng: \\\\\\\"National Security Strategy Theory,\\\\u201d  Beijing, Military Science Press , 2006 edition , p41.\\\", \\\"pageNumber\\\": 181}, \\\"reference_map\\\": null, \\\"score\\\": 18.847267150878906, \\\"normalized_score\\\": 0.5889770984649658, \\\"rank\\\": 3}}, {\\\"page_content\\\": \\\"{date=(2019)}\\\\n106\\\\nMajor Production-Sector Snapshots\\\\nMissile and Space.

Therefore, creating a harmonious air -space environment through \\\\nmutually beneficial cooperation in space and space is the fundamental goal of China's aerospace \\\\nsecurity.  \\\\nThe expansiveness of the air and space field has brought many uncertainties to air and \\\\nspace security, and although the national airspace has relative certainty, the regulations on public airspace, especially in the space field, are not perfect. With the increasingly fierce competition for space interests of various countries, a small number of military powers, backed by their powerful air and space forces, seek space superiority in a  vain attempt to control space, and bring \\\\ngreat obstacles to the peaceful use of space by other countries. Therefore, the security and interests of all countries in space urgently need to establish a regular order to maintain. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: \\\\\\\"Peace is the eternal aspiration of the people. Peace is like air and sunshine, it benefits without it, but it is difficult to survive if it is lost. \\\\\\\"We must abide by the purpose of  safeguarding world \\\\npeace and promoting common development, actively participate in international peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and exchanges between militaries of various countries, actively promote international air and space security cooperation, cr eate a good air and space security environment \\\\nfor safeguarding the period of important strategic opportunities for national development, and contribute to maintaining regional stability and world peace.\\\\\\\"  \\\\n \\\\n4. Use force to support the expansion of national interests  \\\\n With the continuous expansion of China's national interests, security issues such as \\\\nmaritime rights and interests, overseas interests, energy resources, and strategic channels have become increasingly prominent. In the fac e of increasing risks and challenges, we must give full \\\\nplay to the advantages of long- range arrival, rapid maneuver and precision strikes of air and \\\\nspace forces, actively use war and non -war military operations, strengthen overseas use, achieve \\\\nregional arrival, and take joint actions with other national forces to effectively safeguard national interests from infringement. The effective use of air and space forces to meet the practical needs of expanding national interests is also one of the main goals of  China's aerospace security \\\\nstrategy.  \\\\nIn terms of maritime rights and interests, China has rights and interests disputes with \\\\nneighboring countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have become a regular threat to some extent, and need to respond quickly, deal with them in a timely manner, and take the initiative to protect their rights. In terms of overseas interests, Chinese embassies, enterprises, expatriates, students and other groups abroad need the protection of national forces, espec ially in \\\\nthe event of turmoil or natural disasters in the host country, and even more so when the country where it resides, it needs national military forces to protect overseas economic interests and personnel safety.\\\", \\\"pageNumber\\\": 78}, \\\"reference_map\\\": null, \\\"score\\\": 18.50263214111328, \\\"normalized_score\\\": 0.57820725440979, \\\"rank\\\": 5}}, {\\\"page_content\\\": \\\"{date=(2019)}\\\\n10\\\\nChina\\\\u2019s Military Strategy is directed primar-\\\\nily at an internal audience.

In a certain sense, China's choice to transcend the path of \\\\nmilitary expansion with the path of peaceful development and the model of conflict of interests with a mutually  beneficial and win -win model to achieve great rejuvenation is based on objective \\\\npossibility and subjective initiative. Second, the basic national conditions of large developing countries are the foothold for China to choose the path of peaceful developme nt. As a large \\\\ndeveloping country, China's central task is to concentrate on construction, wholeheartedly seek development, and always base its development on basing itself on its own reality. At present, China has initially completed its transformation fr om a large agricultural country to a major \\\\nindustrial country, and the pace of building a moderately prosperous society in an all -round way \\\\nis accelerating, and it has a solid foundation for peaceful development and has become an important link in the worl d economic chain in the process of economic globalization. The vitality \\\\nand attractiveness of China's economy determine that China's ability to freely carry out market development and resource allocation on a global scale is getting stronger and stronger, and there is no need to safeguard and expand national interests through expansion wars. Third, stable politics and strong national defense are the basic guarantees for China to choose the path of peaceful development. From a political point of view, the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ended the century- old history of bullying, war and turmoil in modern times, and \\\\nlaid a solid foundation for China to embark on the path of peaceful development. The profound lessons of the \\\\\\\"Cultural Revoluti on\\\\\\\" in the past 10 years and the valuable experience of reform \\\\nand opening up over the past 30 years have brought China's political ecology into a mature, stable and pragmatic period.
